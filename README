--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This source provides a complete port of the C Bare Bones tutorial from
http://wiki.osdev.org. I copied and modified the linker script from the D port
as the original didn't work for me and also did the same with the startup code
from the original C port.

The full documentation for this project can be found at:

  http://wiki.osdev.org/Ada_Bare_bones

Once you have cloned this repository, you need to set up the links to the
RTS inside rts/boards/i386/adainclude/ to point to those in rts/src/ as follows:

for f in "ada.ads" "a-unccon.ads" "a-uncdea.ads" "gnat.ads" "g-souinf.ads" "interfac.ads" "s-atacco.adb" "s-atacco.ads" "s-maccod.ads" "s-stoele.adb" "s-stoele.ads"
do
ln -s `pwd`/rts/src/$f `pwd`/rts/boards/i386/adainclude/$f
done

The code here is released under the BSD licence, I have not put in licence
indicators for the linker script or the startup code, as I didn't write those.
